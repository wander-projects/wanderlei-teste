Requirements validation
=======================

You can use the `Rollerworks\Bundle\PasswordStrengthBundle\Validator\Constraints\PasswordRequirements`
constraint with the following options.

**Note:** Validation is performed with respect to international encodings,
so the international character `ï¼™` will be treated as 9 in ASCII.

* minLength: Minimum length of the password, should be at least 6 (or 8 for better security).
* requireLetters: Require that the password should at least contain one letter (default `true`).
* requireCaseDiff: Require that the password should at least contain one lowercase and one uppercase letter (default `false`).
* requireNumbers: Require that the password should at least contain one number (default `false`).
* requireSpecialCharacter: Require that the password should at least contain one non lateral or numerical character like `@` (default `false`).

You can customize the validation error messages with the following:

- tooShortMessage = _'Your password must be at least {{length}} characters long.'_
- missingLettersMessage = _'Your password must include at least one letter.'_
- requireCaseDiffMessage = _'Your password must include both upper and lower case letters.'_
- missingNumbersMessage = _'Your password must include at least one number.'_
- missingSpecialCharacterMessage = _'Your password must contain at least one special character.'_

If you are using annotations for validation, include the constraints namespace:

```php
use Rollerworks\Bundle\PasswordStrengthBundle\Validator\Constraints as RollerworksPassword;
```

and then add the PasswordRequirements constraint to the relevant field:

```php
/**
 * @RollerworksPassword\PasswordRequirements(requireLetters=true, requireNumbers=true, requireCaseDiff=true)
 */
protected $password;
```
